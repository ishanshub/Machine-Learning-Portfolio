- ## Machine Learning 
  - [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/ishanshub/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/main/HeartDiseasePrediction): A model to classiy if a person has a potential threat of having a problem related to heart using *Supervised Machine Learning Classification Algorithm* and complex visulization techiniques with a relaiable score of accuracy.
- ## Natural Language Processing
  - [imDb Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/ishanshub/imdb-sentiment-nlp): A model that can classify if the given review text is a positive or negative, the model is trained on a imDb dataset of 50000 labeled text.
- ## Deep Learning
  - [VGG16 from scratch](https://github.com/ishanshub/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/vgg16_from_scratch/vgg16_from_scratch.ipynb): A model built using reference from VGG16 research paper using python library- tensorflow. This is used for image classification.
